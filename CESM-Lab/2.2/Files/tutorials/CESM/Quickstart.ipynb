    "CESM experiments start with creating a 'case' - a configuration of the model with a specific set of component models (eg, CAM for the atmosphere model, POP for the ocean model, etc), at a particular resolution, and with a set of options defined in XML files.  Let's start by using the 'create_newcase' command to set up an experiment with the following details:<br>\n",

This is much less computationally intensive than a fully coupled run, so it works well for this tutorial, only requiring ~0.6GB of RAM.  It will also need to download some input files, totaling approximately 127MB of size.\n",

    "The command to create this configuration is given below, using 'tutorial_aquaplanet' as the casename.  Note that given the size and nature of this run, it's not a scientifically supported configuration, but it's still useful for learning how to run the model.\n",
